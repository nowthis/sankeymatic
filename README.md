### Background:

SankeyMATIC was inspired by the big energy flow diagram in [d3](http://d3js.org/)'s gallery of examples (visible these days [at ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey)).

Initially built on a [fork of that very d3 Sankey library](https://github.com/nowthis/d3-plugin-captain-sankey) and evolving from there, SankeyMATIC is intended to make it possible for anyone with a web browser to generate complex and beautiful flow diagrams while requiring zero knowledge of coding.
